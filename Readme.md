 #Motivation
Network Traffic classification is crucial to tasks such as network management and security. More specifically, it enables network operators to assign priorities to different traffic, as well as employ suitable techniques to apply quality of service (QoS) and security policies based on specific needs of an application.Virtual private networks are a challenge to traditional QoS classification systems because they encrypt data leading to a need for more intelligent systems to detect and classify them.

#Description
In this challenge, you will provide our network engineers with a machine learning solution that can correctly classify the VPN traffic that is passing through the network. We assume that the network engineers already know that traffic is VPN but they want to know what is its type.

Here is a handy link to a starter notebook.

We wish you the best of luck in this challenge, and look forward to seeing your creative and innovative solutions!
